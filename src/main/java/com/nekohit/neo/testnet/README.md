**This package is used for test net only.**

The contract we deployed on test use single address, so we can deploy it using code.

The main net version use a multi-sign address as contract owner. So it has to be
deployed or updated by Neo-GUI. That is the only software has a great support with
multi-sign address.

**DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE ON MAIN NET.**
